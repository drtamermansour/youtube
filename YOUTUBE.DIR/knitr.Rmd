This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We can also create inline equations. The arithmetic mean is equal to $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$, or the summation of n numbers divided by n.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
```

With respect to the data frame **mpg** the average City MPG is
`r round(mean(mpg$cty),2)`, the average Highway mpg is `r mean(mpg$hwy)`
